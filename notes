= Moducks to make =
  == Custom ==
    * Clock repeater (come up with better name)
    * Attenuator
    * Inverter (implement with Processor)
    * Clamper (implement with Processor)
    * SequenceRepeater (better name). Records a buffer, and can freeze and loop whatever it has.
      Maybe just a loop mode for Buffer?

  == Copies ==
    * Trigger riot
    * Z8000
    * Turing machine random looping sequencer
    * Make Noise Rene
    * Circadian Rhythms


= Todo: =
  * Multiplier and Adder should be implemented in terms of Processor2(which also
    needs to be created)
  * Add play speed and step size to Sequencer
  * PulseDiv: When changing divisor, recalculate current step value. Don't reset to 0.
  * Something where I can keep a buffer of length X, and at any moment freeze it, and step around in it.
    Setting areas to loop, and sequencing the various loops with a meta sequencer.
    Kind of on-the-fly chopping, but of sequences instead of audio clips.
