= Moducks to make =
  == Simple ==
    * Clock repeater (come up with better name)
    * Attenuator
    * Inverter (implement with Processor)
    * Clamper (implement with Processor)

  == Complex ==
    * 
  
  == Copies ==
    * Trigger riot
    * Z8000
    * Turing machine random looping sequencer
    * Make Noise Rene
    * Circadian Rhythms


= Todo: =
  * Multiplier and Adder should be implemented in terms of Processor2(which also
    needs to be created)
  * Add play speed and step size to Sequencer
